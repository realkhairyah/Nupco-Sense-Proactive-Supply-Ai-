AI-Driven Proactive Supply System – Nupco Sense

 Overview
Nupco Sense is an AI-driven proactive supply system designed to transform medical supply chain management from a reactive, request-based model into a predictive, demand-sensing model.
The system anticipates future demand for medicines and medical supplies across regions in Saudi Arabia by combining historical consumption data with external risk signals.

Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to predict medical supply demand before shortages occur, enabling proactive inventory rebalancing across regions.
By sensing demand early, the system supports national-level medical supply resilience and ensures continuity of care during environmental or health-related disruptions.

Project Concept
Traditional supply chains rely on hospital requests after demand has already materialized.
This project breaks that limitation by introducing:
 • Demand Sensing:
Detecting early demand signals using historical consumption data combined with external factors such as dust levels, seasonal trends, and environmental risks.
 • Correlation Analysis:
Identifying relationships between external indicators (e.g., increased dust levels or temperature changes) and rising demand for specific medical categories such as respiratory drugs.
 • Intelligent Rebalancing:
Generating data-driven recommendations to move inventory from regions with expected surplus to regions with expected shortages.
 • Waste Reduction:
Minimizing medicine expiration and overstocking by aligning inventory distribution with predicted demand.

 Data & Methodology
 • Historical medical supply consumption data
 • Regional and operational indicators
 • External risk signals (e.g., dust impact on respiratory demand)
 • Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling were applied to forecast demand for the next 10 days.

 Modeling & Analytics
 • Predictive demand forecasting models
 • Risk classification of regions (High / Medium / Safe)
 • Automated identification of high-risk regions
 • Continuous evaluation of forecast accuracy

 Key Results & Impact
The system delivered strong operational and business impact, including:
 • SAR 3.41M total financial impact
 • SAR 3M inventory value safeguarded through proactive rebalancing
 • 100% Critical Action Rate, ensuring all predicted risks were addressed before stockouts occurred
 • 6.61K days of potential supply downtime avoided
 • 13 high-risk regions identified within a 10-day forecast window
 • 0.79 forecast accuracy score, demonstrating reliable predictive performance

 Visualization & Decision Support (Power BI)
All insights were translated into interactive Power BI dashboards, providing:
 • National medical supply risk radar
 • Regional demand heatmaps
 • Forecasted demand trends for the next 10 days
 • Inventory transfer flows between regions
 • Clear KPIs for executive decision-makers
 Dashboard snapshots are included in the images/ folder.

 Tech Stack
 • Python
 • Pandas, NumPy

Future Enhancements
 • Integration with real-time environmental and health data streams
 • Advanced deep learning forecasting models
 • Deployment as a national decision-support platform

 Elevator Pitch
“This project doesn’t tell Nupco what it has today — it tells it what to move tomorrow to save lives and optimize resources.”
